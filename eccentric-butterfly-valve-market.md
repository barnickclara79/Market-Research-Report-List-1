<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eccentric Butterfly Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Eccentric</li><li>Double Eccentric</li><li>Triple Eccentric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The eccentric butterfly valve market is divided into three types based on the degree of eccentricity: single eccentric, double eccentric, and triple eccentric. Single eccentric valves have a simple offset disc, allowing for quick closure but with less tight sealing. Double eccentric valves further offset the disc to enhance sealing capability and reduce wear. Triple eccentric valves feature a unique design that fully separates the disc from the seat, providing excellent sealing performance and durability, making them suitable for high-pressure applications.</p></p>
