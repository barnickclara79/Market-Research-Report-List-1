<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle tyre market primarily consists of radial and bias tyres. Radial tyres feature layers of fabric cords running perpendicular to the tread, offering better fuel efficiency, durability, and grip, making them dominant in modern vehicles. Bias tyres have crisscrossed cord layers, providing sturdiness and load-bearing capacity but with less flexibility and higher rolling resistance. While radial tyres dominate due to performance advantages, bias tyres are still used in specific applications like off-road or vintage vehicles, where durability and simplicity are prioritized over efficiency.</p></p>
