<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photo Curing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free-radical Type</li><li>Cationic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photo curing agent market is primarily divided into two types: free-radical and cationic. Free-radical photo curing agents initiate polymerization through the generation of free radicals upon exposure to light, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including inks and coatings. In contrast, cationic photo curing agents rely on cationic polymerization, which is more efficient in producing highly cross-linked and stable coatings. Each type serves distinct applications based on curing speed, temperature resistance, and environmental factors.</p></p>
