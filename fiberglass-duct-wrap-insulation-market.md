<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Duct Wrap Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Facings</li><li>Without Facings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass duct wrap insulation is categorized into two main types based on the presence of facings. Insulation “with facings” includes a protective layer that enhances moisture resistance and acts as a vapor barrier, making it ideal for HVAC systems in humid environments. Conversely, “without facings” lacks this protective layer, offering a more flexible and lightweight solution suitable for areas where moisture is less of a concern. Both types provide effective thermal insulation, improving energy efficiency and reducing noise in duct systems.</p></p>
