<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facade Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventilated Facade Systems</li><li>Non-Ventilated Facade Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Facade systems are essential components of building exteriors, categorized into two main types: ventilated and non-ventilated systems. Ventilated facade systems feature an air gap between the cladding and insulation, promoting airflow that enhances thermal performance and moisture control, often improving energy efficiency. In contrast, non-ventilated facade systems lack this air gap, relying primarily on insulation materials for thermal protection. Both systems cater to different architectural needs, climate considerations, and aesthetic preferences, influencing market dynamics in construction and design sectors.</p></p>
